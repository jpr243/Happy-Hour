# Happy-Hour

The project brief was to conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem 
by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

As a result of working collaboratively, team members learnt agile development methodologies and 
implemented feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.
